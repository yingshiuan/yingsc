# My Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for scalability and performance. Its component-based architecture allows integration of frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) ornpm [React](https://reactjs.org/) for interactive components, while showcasing **my projects** and **skills**.


Key advantages of using Astro:
- **Scalable architecture**: Easily add new pages or components without affecting site performance.  
- **Framework flexibility**: Mix and match frameworks (Vue, React, Svelte, etc.) for specific parts of the site.  
- **Performance-first**: Static HTML output by default, with hydration only where necessary.  
- **SEO-friendly**: Automatic sitemap generation and fast-loading pages improve search engine visibility.
